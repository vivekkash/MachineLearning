A member of the Pataudi family, she is the daughter of actors Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan and the paternal granddaughter of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Sharmila Tagore. After graduating from Columbia University, Khan ventured into acting by playing the leading lady in the 2018 films Kedarnath and Simmba. Both films were commercially successful and the former earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.\\n',\n",
       " \"Sara Ali Khan was born on 12 August 1995 in Mumbai to Saif Ali Khan, son of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Sharmila Tagore, and Amrita Singh; both actors of the Hindi film industry.[3][4] A member of the Pataudi family,[5] she is also the maternal granddaughter of Rukhsana Sultana and Shivinder Singh Virk.[6] She has a younger brother, Ibrahim Ali Khan.[7] Her half-brother, Taimur Ali Khan, is Saif's son from his second marriage to Kareena Kapoor.[8] Khan is of predominantly Bengali and Pathan descent on her father's side, and of Punjabi descent on her mother's side.[9][10]\\n\",\n",
       " 'When Khan was a four-year-old, she acted in an advertisement.[11] According to Saif, the actress Aishwarya Rai proved to be her inspiration for pursuing a career in film after she saw her perform on stage at Chicago.[11][12] In 2004, when Khan was nine, her parents divorced, and Singh was granted legal guardianship of her children.[13] Saif was initially not allowed to see her or her brother;[13] they have since reconciled, and, according to Saif, \"are more like friends [than father and daughter]\".[14] Khan also shares a healthy relationship with Kapoor, her step-mother; she stated in 2018, \"I would like to imbibe her professionalism in me\".[15]\\n',\n",
       " 'As a teenager, Khan struggled with her weight, and had to undergo daily workouts under a strict schedule to get fit.[16] She was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, which she ascribes as a cause for her weight gain.[17] Khan studied history and political science at Columbia University in New York.[18][19][20] In 2016, she completed her graduation early, within three years, and took off the remaining one-and-a-half years for weight training, following which she returned to India.[20][21]\\n',\n",
       " 'Khan\\'s debut came in 2018 with the Abhishek Kapoor-directed inter-faith romance Kedarnath, in which she played a Hindu girl who falls in love with a Muslim porter played by Sushant Singh Rajput.[22] In preparation for her role, Khan improved her knowledge of Hindi vocabulary with help from Rajput.[23] In February 2018, a dispute between Kapoor and KriArj Entertainment, the producers, led to the latter losing the film\\'s rights to RSVP Movies, who produced it alongside Kapoor.[24][22] A few weeks before release, priests of Kedarnath Temple demanded the film\\'s boycott as they believed it promoted Love Jihad, and a Bharatiya Janata Party leader also urged for a ban.[25][26] As a result, the film was banned in the state of Uttarakhand.[27] Kedarnath received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan\\'s performance.[28] Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror found it to be a rehash of 1980s Hindi films but appreciated Khan\\'s act: \"When her Mukku is angry, hopeful, desperate or coltish, she often conveys it through her eyes alone — giving us a taste of the diverse faces she can throw on.\"[29] Meena Iyer of Daily News and Analysis similarly wrote, \"It is hard to believe that this is [Khan\\'s] first film because she is so spectacular\".[30] Kedarnath grossed over ₹966 million (US$14\\xa0million) worldwide against a budget of ₹350 million (US$5.1\\xa0million) to emerge as a commercial success.[31][32] Khan was awarded with the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year – Female.[33][34]\\n',\n",
       " 'A few weeks after the release of Kedarnath, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty\\'s action film Simmba, alongside Ranveer Singh, which was loosely based on the Telugu-language film Temper (2015).[35] She began work on it when filming of Kedarnath was temporarily suspended.[36][37] This led to Abhishek Kapoor suing Khan; they later settled out of court when she agreed to split her time between both films.[38][39] Reviewing the film for The Times of India, Ronak Kotecha opined that Khan had \"precious little to do besides looking breathtakingly beautiful\" and disliked the chemistry between her and Singh.[40] With worldwide earnings of ₹4 billion (US$58\\xa0million), Simmba emerged as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2018.[41]\\n',\n",

Mukku (Sara Ali Khan ) the daughter of a Hindu Brahmin priest who runs the hostel for pilgrims by the temple on behalf of the temple committee. She is engaged to another Brahmin, nephew of the head priest. He was meant to marry her older sister, but he dumped the sister and switched to her when she grew up to be prettier. And her father agreed. In rebellion (since there is no other way to rebel), Mukku flirts with the local boys and convinces them to come to her house and propose in order to embarrass her father and fiance. However, Mansoor is different, they both notice each other and then Mukku makes the first move and hires him as her regular porter as she goes from her family home to a neighbouring village to help at her uncle’s shop. She talks and talks to him and flirts outrageously and finally gets enough of a reaction to know he feels the same way.  They are trapped in the rain together, share stories of their childhood, and then kiss. Her envious sister tells Mansoor that Mukku is just flirting with him as she has flirted with all the other boys. Mukku is unable to defend herself when he confronts her, but starts following him around everywhere, finally sitting in the rain outside his house. Her sister tries to cover for her, but she is found out and her family and the rest of the Brahmin community come for her planning to throw out all the Muslims. Which, not-so-coincidentally, will also open up space for the new luxury hotel they are planning.\\n',\n",

While the Muslim porter community prepares to leave the valley, Mansoor decides not to leave without Mukku. \\nMukku is married and attempts to commit suicide, however she is saved by her family, her now-husband taunts Mansoor with the news. Mansoor runs to Mukku and promises he will come back for her that night when she is recovered, so they can leave the valley together. Her husband plans to take his band of priests and kill Mansoor and drive out all the Muslims in Hindu deity Shiva’s name. All of a sudden the rains and the floods begin. Mansoor sends his mother with the other porters into the mountains and runs towards Mukku. She and her family are trying to gather the guests of their hostel in a top floor, her husband and his mother arrive driven in by the storm and Mukku refuses to go to him. And then the floor crashes down and her sister and mother are swept away along with half the other people. Mukku and her father and a few others make their way to the temple, Mansoor finds them there just as the water sweeps down. He grabs her hand in the flood, and her father holds on to her and all three are saved. After the water goes down, they make their way to a house that is still standing and wave at an Indian army helicopter that is coming to save them. Mansoor sends up the woman and child who are with them first, then Mukku’s father, then Mukku, and finally prepares to go himself. But there is only space for one more person and the father of the family has not gone yet, so Mansoor sacrifices himself and sends him instead. Three years later, Mukku is still seen living with her father and running the lodge, listening to Mansoor's favourite song on the radio which she dedicated to him and smiles.\\n\",\n",

Due to having free days as per the Kedarnath producers' court case, Khan allotted those days to film with the Simmba crew; this decision was unfitting to Kedarnath director Kapoor who took Khan to court. The two eventually settled out of court as Khan agreed to split her time between both films.[19] The case also had an effect on the release of the film; as the producers ended up losing several lucrative prospective release slots near the end of the year; it seemed as if the film would be releasing in 2019 and that Rohit Shetty-directed Simmba would be Sara Ali Khan's debut film. However, when the producers' of Ajay Devgn-starrer Total Dhamaal relinquished their 7 December release date in favor of late February 2019, RSVP Movies was quick to secure it for Kedarnath.[20]\\n\",\n",

Featured opposited Deepika Padukone, the film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth, and Khan played dual roles—the younger part of Rishi Kapoor\\'s character (Veer Singh) and Jai Vardhan Singh, an ambitious architect. Love Aaj Kal received mostly positive reviews by critics and became one of the highest-grossing films of the year, earning over ₹1 billion (US$14\\xa0million) worldwide.[76] Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times described his performance as \"refreshing natural\" and \"outstanding\".[81] At the 55th Filmfare Awards, the feature was nominated for Best Film and Khan received an additional nomination for Best Actor.[15] He then starred in the dramatic thriller Kurbaan, alongside Kareena Kapoor and Vivek Oberoi. Produced by Dharma Productions, the film marked the directorial debut of Rensil D\\'Silva and featured Khan in the role of a terrorist. Upon release, Kurbaan was received favourably by critics and Khan\\'s performance was critically acclaimed.

To prepare for the role, Khan was required to take acting workshops along with the rest of the cast.[84] Prior to its release, the film was banned from releasing in select cities across India due to its controversial subject.[83] While the film received a mixed critical reaction, his performance was generally well received.[85] The following year, Khan produced both of his films. For his first release, he collaborated once again with director Sriram Raghavan, as the protagonist in the action thriller Agent Vinod. Khan described it as his \"most ambitious project\",[86] but the film opened to mixed reviews and eventually under-performed at the box office grossing ₹400 million (US$5.8\\xa0million) in India on a budget of ₹620 million (US$9.0\\xa0million).[87]\\n',\n",

Khan described the project as \"a love story with a modern sensibility and treatment\", and agreed to produce and feature in the film after his role was declined by Imran Khan.[88] Critics were divided in their opinion of the film,[89] but it emerged a financial success grossing over ₹1.2 billion (US$17\\xa0million) worldwide.[76] Gaurav Malani of The Times of India described Khan\\'s performance as \"effortless\" and noted that he was in his \"comfort zone\".[90] On 16 October 2012, Khan married actress Kareena Kapoor (after a five-year courtship) in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai, and a reception was later held at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Lutyens Bungalow Zone in Mumbai and Delhi respectively.[91]\\n',\n",

The film received predominantly negative reviews from critics,[92] but with a total collection of ₹1.62 billion (US$23\\xa0million), it proved to be a commercial success and his highest-grossing film to date.[76] He was next cast as the \"Russian mafia don\",[93] Boris in Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K.\\'s Go Goa Gone (a film described as \"India\\'s first zom-com\")[94] alongside Kunal Khemu and Vir Das. Khan, who bleached his hair for the film, was particularly drawn to the project for its novel concept and its \"action, comedy and violence\".[95][96] The critic Rajeev Masand described the film as \"a winning cocktail of laugh-out-loud dialogue and well-timed performances by the three leads\", and in particular noted Khan\\'s scene with Khemu\\'s character.[94] His final release of the year was Bullett Raja, a crime drama directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia, and co-starring Jimmy Shergill and Sonakshi Sinha. Khan explained that he found himself challenged playing the role of Raja Mishra (a common man who turns into a gangster) but \"totally relied\" on the director\\'s guidance.[97] Bullett Raja earned little at the box office and received predominantly negative reviews.

Phantom generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Censors deemed that the film represented Pakistan in a negative light and banned the film from releasing there.[103] A review in The Hollywood Reporter noted that Khan was \"well cast\" and \"believable\" in his role,[104] and Rachit Gupta of Filmfare described his performance as \"a heady mix of bravado and restrained intensity [which] works in parts only.\"[105] Although Khan was pleased with the film\\'s performance, Phantom was generally perceived to be a box-office failure grossing ₹844 million (US$12\\xa0million) worldwide on a budget of ₹720 million (US$10\\xa0million).[106][107]\\n',\n",

Cast alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut, Khan drew inspirations from the mannerisms of his grandfather and the character Darth Vader to portray filmmaker Rustom \"Rusi\" Billimoria.[109] Rajeev Masand termed the film \"overlong, indulgent to the point of exhaustion\", but praised Khan for \"imbu[ing] Russi with the swagger and the arrogance of an aristocrat from the forties\".[110]\\n',\n",
